    "data": "I’ve been a programmer for 4 years now. Over that time, I’ve had the chance to work at some great companies including CompareTheMarket.com (current) and Philips. As a developer, I’m constantly challenging myself to learn new things. At university, my passion for learning allowed me to achieve a First, but after university, I’ve worked hard to keep learning and developing. As well as learning for myself I’m keen to feedback and share what I have learned with others. I have a blog on Medium which has CompareTheMarket.com’s most read article, and recently taught React at a ‘CodeBar’ event in London."
