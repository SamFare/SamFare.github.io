# Website template

### Description
This is the repositry for the template used on my website [SamFare.me](SamFare.me "Click for website goodness"). Feel free to chack it out.


### Use
All the React components in this repository are ripe for reuse, you're welcome to reuse or modify any either individually or all together under the MIT License (See licence section for License details). The contents of the assets folder, however, contains my personal career data an should not be reused. Work is planned to remove the said folder in the future and keep this repo as a template. If you want to use the website template now, simply fork the repo and replace the assets folder.

### Instalation. 
 
Getting started is simple, Just pull the source code and run: 

`npm install`

To run the code simply type: 

`npm run start`

And navigate to [http://localhost:8080]

And to run tests simply run

`npm run test`
