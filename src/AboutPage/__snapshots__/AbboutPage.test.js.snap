      I’ve been a programmer for 4 years now. Over that time I’ve had the chance to work at some great companies Including CompareTheMarket.com (current) and Philips.

 As a developer I challenge myself and learn new things. At university my passion for learning allowed me to achieve a First, But after university I’ve worked hard to keep learning and developing.

As well as learning for myself I’m keen to feed back and share what I have learned with others. I have a blog on medium which has CompareTheMarket.com’s most read article . And recently taught React at a Codebar event in london.

I have the luck to present "I did mob programming every day for 5 months, Here’s what I learnt" at Meta - the BGL groups internal confrence on the 10th of may. The talk is based on my article of the same name (avaliable here: https://goo.gl/wLXAHH). The article is the most read on the Compare the market blog with 28,000 views.

At comparethemarket I have worked hard to enhance my Javascript skills while working on a ES6 UI for a application that supports the interaction between CTM and our panel of providers. Comparethemarket has also given me the opportunity to experience new techniques such as pair and mob programming.

I also worked on a c# 7 based project that integrates the quotes that are received from providers into the main site. This project has allowed me to deep dive into the workings of .NET including a deep look at .Net Memory management for Fixing a memory leak.

            Key Tech: Javascript (ES6), AngularJS, Magik

At GE I demonstrated my leadership and communication ability by becoming the team leader for the companies first aiders. This involved coordinating first aiders to cover events (like the company first aid tournament) and organising the rotors to check our defibrillators and first aid kits.

I also demonstrated my ability to pick up things quickly by working on the Smallworld product portfolio in a GE language called magik. The smallworld portfolio helps large utility companies look after their assets. 

I Also had the opportunity to work on an ES6 dashboard for reporting of our Code coverage statistics. This dashboards was used by every team on site to report up.

At philips I worked on a project monitoring ICU patients and passing the data on to doctors working remotely. This my area of this project was written in Javascript/Angular.r

At philips I had the opportunity to work internationally, regularly visiting our offices in Eindhoven and Aachen. This improved my communication and interpersonal skills.
